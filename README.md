## About the Locomotion
The locomotion used in GorillaLoco+ as mentioned prior is based off of [GorillaLocomotion](https://github.com/Another-Axiom/GorillaLocomotion), albeit an updated version of the locomotion from April 2022. This locomotion introduces all-new mechanics such as tap sounds when you touch objects, and slippery surfaces such as ice, but it also includes updates and fixes to make it better to use for the player.
## About the Project
The project used for GorillaLoco+ is already ready for Virtual Reality for Oculus/Meta and Valve index devices, other devices can also be added with XR Plugin Management. The project also comes with a testing scene which utilizes different objects being used by the locomotion.
